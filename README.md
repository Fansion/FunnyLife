FunnyLife
=========

Introduction
---------
Here is a backup of programs wrote for a wechat public account named FunnyLife(can be search on wechat). 

It mainly consists of serval .php files and a dir for pics used for the service. Also there is a .py file(getScore) crawing scores from yjs.ustc.edu.cn.


Environment
---------
Programs are deployed on a virtual machine(only 1G mem) on cloud.ustc.edu.cn with a public IP address(thx for admins of cloud.ustc.edu.cn). Nginx, php5-fpm, and mysql are needed for running the service. 


Background
---------
I got the idea of writing programs for an account in 'https://mp.weixin.qq.com' since 2013-10(or later). At first , I mainly learned from http://www.cnblogs.com/txw1958/p/wechat-tutorial.html, http://blog.csdn.net/lyq8479/article/category/1366622/, http://www.zhongyaofang.cn/combat_power/weixin_jiaocheng_vol1.html as well as some other ways. Later I refer to two books, http://www.weixingon.com/wechat/wechatappdev.php(more userful for me) and http://book.douban.com/subject/25710483/. 

At first I mainly implement functions without a complete framework in my programs. Then I learned how to deal with mysql in php roundly. Codes here are wrote without referring to framework talked in http://www.zhongyaofang.cn/combat_power/weixin_jiaocheng_vol1.html.

In addtion, I will choose to read http://book.douban.com/subject/25838708/(in a Java way) if time is convenient. Actually there are so much to learn to write good codes.


Remarks
---------
Personal data are replaced by xxxxxx. CCJ module is implemented mainly for the convenience of checking scores in yjs.ustc.edu.cn.
